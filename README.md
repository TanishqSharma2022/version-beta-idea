## Efficient Air-Quality Index Monitoring System

### Abstract

The PYourly project aims to revolutionize the way individuals monitor and protect themselves from exposure to harmful air pollutants by developing a portable, high-quality Air Quality Index (AQI) sensor that provides real-time feedback. PYourly sets itself apart from existing solutions by offering offline capabilities and addressing the limitations of current techniques, while highlighting the critical health risks associated with prolonged exposure to poor air quality.

### Features

1. Highly sensitive sensor with continuous readings of Air Quality Index (AQI) throughout the day, to monitor the user's risk fo over-exposure to air pollution.
2. Detects over-exposure and sends a warning notification to the user.

### What sets us apart?

Low latency, good UI, accurate measurements, low cost
