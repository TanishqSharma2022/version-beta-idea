## Efficient Air-Quality Index Monitoring System

### Abstract

The Pyourly project aims to revolutionize the way individuals monitor and protect themselves from exposure to harmful air pollutants by developing a portable, high-quality Air Quality Index (AQI) sensor and monitoring system that provides _real-time feedback_. Pyourly sets itself apart from existing solutions by offering _offline_ capabilities and addressing the limitations of current techniques, while highlighting the _critical health risks_ associated with prolonged exposure to poor air quality.

### Features

1. Highly sensitive sensor with continuous readings of Air Quality Index (AQI) throughout the day, to monitor the user's risk fo over-exposure to air pollution.
2. Detects over-exposure and sends a warning notification to the user.
3. Display a history of the user's surrounding AQI and analysis of the same.
4. While the integrated sensor reads the AQI inside the room, AQI of the surroundings is fetched from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution) and the comparison is displayed to the user.
5. The integrated sensor data is synced on [Microsoft Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/) for storage and analysis, securely, protecting the user's privacy.

### What sets us apart?
